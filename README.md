**Concept**  
* Drive a tank, using terrain & skill to destroy other tanks whilst avoiding damage.

**Rules**  
* Can move anywhere in terrain (but not over surrounding mountains)
* Both players start with finite health and ammo
* Each direct hit takes away health
* Last player standing wins

**Requirements**  
* SFX: Driving/engine, gun firing, explosion, turret moving, barrel moving
* Static meshes: simple tank (tracks, body, turrent, barrel)
* Textures: later on to add visual flare
